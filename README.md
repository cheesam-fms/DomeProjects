# 🌀 Dome Projects Collection

Welcome to my personal archive of dome-related Unity projects and references. This repository serves as a reference hub for experiments, learning, and prototyping immersive dome experiences.

## 🎯 What's Inside

This collection includes:

- 🎥 **Full-Dome Camera Setups** – For rendering immersive 180°/360° visuals  
- 🌐 **360° Projection Mapping** – Techniques to map content accurately onto domes  
- 🔊 **Spatial Audio Environments** – Integrating sound that responds to spatial context  
- 💡 **Lighting & Shader Effects** – Custom shaders and lighting tailored for domes  
- 🧩 **DomeTools & Plugins** – Projects using tools like DomeTools for easier dome development

## 🧪 Purpose

These projects are not necessarily polished or production-ready. They're saved for:

- Reference and study  
- Building blocks for future projects  
- Exploration of dome-specific workflows in Unity
