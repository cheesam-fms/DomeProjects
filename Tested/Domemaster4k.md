A Unity-based fulldome rendering solution designed for **Built-in Render Pipeline**, focused on **4K resolution** fulldome production.

### 🧰 Features

- Utilizes **four cameras** to render separate views.
- Outputs to **four individual textures**, each mapped to a mesh.
- Combines the four views to form a complete **180° dome projection**.

---

### ⚠️ Limitations & Notes

- Although it achieves a clean 180° fulldome result, it is **not resource-efficient**:
  - Uses **four cameras** just for 180°, whereas some cubemap-based techniques can render full 360° using six cameras.
- Primarily intended for **offline or pre-rendered content**, where visual accuracy is more important than performance.
- Not ideal for real-time applications or performance-constrained environments.
